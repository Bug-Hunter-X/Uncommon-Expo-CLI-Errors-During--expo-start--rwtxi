The solution involves systematic troubleshooting, starting with the easiest steps.  

**1. Verify and Reinstall Dependencies:**
   - Carefully examine your `package.json`. Correct any typos or inconsistencies in the dependency names or versions.
   - In your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory.
   - Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you're using Yarn) to ensure all packages are correctly installed and up-to-date.

**2. Update or Reinstall Expo CLI:**
   - Run `expo upgrade` to ensure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI.
   - If this doesn't help, consider uninstalling and reinstalling Expo CLI following Expo's official documentation for your operating system.

**3. Check Platform-Specific Configurations:**
   - **iOS:** If you're working with iOS, check your Xcode setup, provisioning profiles, and bundle identifier configuration. Make sure your code signing is correct and that you have a valid development certificate.
   - **Android:** Examine your Android SDK setup, emulator settings, and the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Verify correct configurations related to your target Android version and permissions.

**4. Address OS Permissions:**
   - Restart your computer.  Sometimes, temporary file locks or other system-level issues may need a simple reboot to clear up.
   - Temporarily disable any anti-virus or firewall software that might be blocking necessary processes for Expo.

**5. Create a New Project (Last Resort):**
   - Create a fresh Expo project using `expo init new-project`. If the new project builds and runs without errors, the problem is within your original project's files.  Try to identify and fix these issues or copy the code to your new project. 
   - If that doesn't solve the problem, it's possible the project files are corrupted, and it might be necessary to review every file carefully.
