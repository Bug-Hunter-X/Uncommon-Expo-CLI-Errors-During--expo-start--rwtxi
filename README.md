# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors During `expo start`

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting steps for resolving uncommon errors encountered when running `expo start`.  These errors are often not directly related to code within your app but rather stem from issues in your project's setup, dependencies, or the Expo CLI environment itself.

**Common Scenarios Covered:**

* Incorrect or missing dependencies
* Problems with the Expo CLI installation
* Issues with platform-specific settings (iOS/Android)
* OS-level permission conflicts
* Corrupted project files

The `expoBug.js` file simulates a project with potential problems (though this is a demonstration and doesn't have specific code errors directly).  The `expoBugSolution.js` file offers detailed troubleshooting and solutions for each scenario.

This repository is intended to help developers diagnose and fix these difficult-to-trace Expo CLI issues.
