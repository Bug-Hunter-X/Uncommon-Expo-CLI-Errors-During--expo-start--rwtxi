This error typically occurs when using Expo's `start` command and often points to an issue with your project's configuration, dependencies, or the Expo CLI itself.  It's not a specific, easily-identifiable code error within your app's source code but rather a problem with the build or development environment. Here are some potential scenarios and troubleshooting steps: 

**Scenario 1: Incorrect or Missing Dependencies**
```bash
expo start
...
Error: ... (Something went wrong, usually related to a package not found or an incorrect version)
```
**Solution:** Check your `package.json`. Ensure all dependencies listed are correctly installed and compatible with each other. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to refresh your dependencies. Pay attention to any version conflicts reported during the installation process.

**Scenario 2: Problems with Expo CLI**
```bash
 expo start
...
Error: ... (Expo CLI-related issue, possibly permissions or a corrupted installation)
```
**Solution:** Try updating Expo CLI: `expo upgrade` or reinstalling it completely, then restart your computer. If this doesn't resolve the problem, check that node and npm versions are compatible with the latest expo release.

**Scenario 3: Issues with iOS/Android specific settings**
If the problem is iOS specific, check Xcode configuration, provisioning profiles, bundle identifiers. Android-specific problems might require checking your Android SDK installation, emulator configuration, and correct AndroidManifest.xml configuration. 

**Scenario 4: OS-Level Permissions**
Rarely, there can be OS-level permissions that interfere with Expo. Try restarting your computer, ensuring appropriate permissions, and temporarily disabling any third-party antivirus software.

**Scenario 5: Corrupted Project**
If other solutions fail, consider creating a new Expo project as a test to see if the problem lies with the current project's files or structure. If the new project works, then there is something wrong with your files. You could try running `rm -rf node_modules` and reinstall by running `npm install` or `yarn install` then restart expo.
